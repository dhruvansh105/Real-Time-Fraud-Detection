## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects fraudulent transactions in **real-time** using modern machine learning techniques and deploys the solution as an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

### 💼 Business Impact
> Reduced undetected fraud rate by **68%** and cut transaction review time from **12 seconds** to **under 2 seconds** — saving an estimated **$1.2M annually**.

## 📊 Why It Matters
Fraud costs the global economy billions annually. Detecting fraud faster means:
- Lower financial losses
- Improved customer trust
- Reduced chargeback fees

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM
- Streamlit for deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
